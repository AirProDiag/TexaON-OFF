TEXA ON and OFF .download files are just a file version of sorts of the .lnk extension Windows uses for shortcuts. It has settings preset to Administrator mode and a target to the two PS scripts (disable, enable) that get 
loaded into C:/Scripts on tools. Automate automatically fixes the extension from .download to .lnk which makes it pop up as an ordinary shortcut on the desktop. 

The two .ps1 (Powershell) scripts work as they say. Disable TEXA turns off two drivers in device manager and also has lines of code to kill TEXA if it's still open. TEXA ON just turns drivers on.
